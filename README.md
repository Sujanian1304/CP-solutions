# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my curated solutions to various **Competitive Programming (CP)** problems from platforms like **Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, and more**. Each file includes:
- **Problem name & URL** (for direct access to the original problem)
- Platform information
- Clean, efficient, and well-structured C++ solutions

---

## üìå Features
- Direct problem links in every file (e.g., [B. Absent Remainder](https://codeforces.com/contest/1613/problem/B))
- Solutions written in **C++ (optimized for contests)**
- Covers a wide range of topics: sorting, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graphs, number theory, and more
- Easy to browse and reference for learning or revision
